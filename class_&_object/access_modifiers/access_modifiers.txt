Access Modifiers 
==================
Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed. 

In C++, there are three access specifiers:
============================================
1) public - members are accessible from inside & outside of the class.
2) private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class & also can not be accessed in inherited classes but can be accessed inside the class.
3) protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes & inside the class.

NOTES:
1) By default, all members of a class are private if you don't specify an access specifier.
